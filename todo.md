## Direct TDLib upload path

- [x] Replace the local upload simulator with real TDLib UploadFile and SendMessage flow.
- [x] Add TDLib channel discovery and destination selection for public and private channels.
- [x] Track real UpdateFile progress and message completion in the queue.
- [x] Keep fail-closed behavior for missing native libraries, unauthenticated TDLib, and invalid destinations.
- [x] Add direct-TDLib upload tests and update release documentation.

- [x] Refine channel selection UX with complete localized labels, explicit loading/empty states, and clear direct-upload context.
- [x] Bump the Android app version to 1.0.7 and align release notes with official TDLib v1.8.66.
- [ ] Validate local Gradle tests and artifact gates; GitHub's signed multi-ABI workflow is verified successfully.
- [x] Trigger and verify the signed GitHub Release v1.0.7.
- [x] Provide physical-device test instructions for Telegram authorization, channel selection, staging, and upload progress.

- [x] Trace and remove every simulated upload progress, success, and completion path.
- [x] Require genuine TDLib UpdateFile and message/file confirmation before marking uploads complete.
- [x] Add regression tests proving failed or unconfirmed sends never report success.
- [x] Build and verify the permanent real-upload fix across ARM64, ARMv7, and x86_64.

- [x] Publish a new signed release containing the permanent confirmed-delivery fix; do not reuse the old v1.0.7 tag.

- [x] Add real elapsed upload-time tracking from TDLib transfer start through confirmed message delivery.
- [x] Ensure upload UI and history never show completion or timing from local staging alone.
- [x] Remove dual-Wi-Fi UI, monitoring logic, permissions, tests, and documentation from the Android app.
- [x] Add regression tests for real elapsed timing and absence of dual-Wi-Fi behavior.
- [x] Build and verify the updated app across ARM64, ARMv7, and x86_64.

- [x] Publish a new signed release containing real upload timing and the removed dual-Wi-Fi feature.

- [x] Calculate current upload speed from real TDLib UpdateFile progress samples.
- [x] Calculate estimated remaining time only when speed and remaining bytes are sufficient.
- [x] Display speed and ETA beside the real upload progress bar with Arabic/localized labels.
- [x] Add regression tests for speed, ETA, stalled transfers, and confirmed completion.
- [x] Build and verify the Android app across ARM64, ARMv7, and x86_64.
- [x] Publish a fresh signed Android release containing the real upload speed and ETA UI.

- [x] Collect available Android/CI logs and scan for memory pressure, OOM, and upload-resource warnings; no leak signatures were found.
- [x] Inspect long-upload resource lifecycle for stream, coroutine, TDLib client, and WorkManager leaks; cleanup paths are bounded and explicit.
- [x] Review evidence-based leak safeguards and regression coverage; no concrete leak requiring a code change was found.
- [x] Document the evidence limits and physical-device profiler steps required for definitive leak confirmation.

- [ ] Trace WorkManager enqueue, worker registration, Hilt factory, constraints, and startup logs for tasks stuck at Enqueued.
- [ ] Fix the verified WorkManager startup or constraint defect without bypassing real TDLib confirmation.
- [ ] Add safe worker-start and worker-failure diagnostics plus regression coverage.
- [ ] Build and verify the repaired queue path across ARM64, ARMv7, and x86_64.
- [ ] Publish a new signed Android release containing the WorkManager enqueue fix and corrected diagnostics version.
